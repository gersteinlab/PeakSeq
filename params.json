Requires a set of mapped reads from ChIP enriched and Input DNA (or some other control) based\r\nsequencing experiment.\r\n\r\nRefer to the paper for explanation of the method\r\nPeakSeq Systematic Scoring of ChIP-Seq Experiments Relative to Controls\r\nRozowsky J, Euskirchen G, Auerbach R, Zhang Z, Gibson T, Bjornson R, Carriero N, Snyder M, Gerstein M\r\nNature Biotechnology 27, 66 - 75 (2009).\r\n\r\nThis new version is re-coded by Arif Harmanci under supervision of Joel Rozowsky. For more info see http://info.gersteinlab.org/PeakSeq\r\n\r\nInstallation \r\n=============\r\nExtract the folder, then do make. PeakSeq is built into bin directory.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n======\r\nThe mapped read files that contain the ChIP-Seq reads and the control reads must be preprocessed into a binary file format that PeakSeq can access fast. This is performed by running PeakSeq with -preprocess option. Currently PeakSeq can preprocess three mapped read file formats SAM, tagAlign, and ELAND. \r\n\r\nFor example, following command reads the mapped reads in the file named pol2_chip_seq.eland and dumps the processed reads into the folder Pol2_ChIP\r\n.PeakSeq -preprocess ELAND chr_id_list.txt pol2_chip_seq.eland Pol2_ChIP\r\nchr_id_list.txt is the list of chromosomes to be processed. These must match chromosome ids in the mapped read file. \r\n\r\nBAM files can be processed first by samtools package then be piped into PeakSeq\r\nsamtools view pol2_chip_seq.bam  .PeakSeq -preprocess SAM chr_id_list.txt stdin Pol2_ChIP\r\nwhere the input file name is specified as stdin to indicate that the mapped reads are piped into PeakSeq.\r\n\r\nAfter preprocessing, the peaks can be called using -peak_select option. PeakSeq requires a configuration file for calling the peaks where several parameters are specified in each line in the '[id] [value]' format. An example configuration file is as follows\r\n\r\nconfig.dat\r\nExperiment id is used as a prefix to the output file name.\r\nExperiment_id pol2_peaks\r\n\r\nChromosome ID list file, is used to generate data file paths.\r\nchromosome_list_file chr_id_list.txt\r\n\r\nEnrichment fragment length For tag extension, this is the value of average fragment length.\r\nEnrichment_fragment_length 200\r\n\r\nTarget FDR in the simulations.\r\ntarget_FDR 0.05\r\n\r\nNumber of simulations performed while estimating the putative peaks.\r\nN_Simulations 10\r\n\r\nMinimum distance between consecutive peaks\r\nMinimum_interpeak_distance 200\r\n\r\nMappability file that includes the uniquely mappable number of nucleotides per window for each chromosome.\r\nMappability_map_file Mapability_HG.txt\r\n\r\nThe directory that contains the preprocessed ChIP-Seq reads, can specify multiple directories to pool reads from multiple source (e.g. replicates)\r\nChIP_Seq_reads_data_dirs Pol2_ChIP\r\n\r\nThe directory that contains the preprocessed Input (control) experiment reads. (Multiple directories allowed)\r\nInput_reads_data_dirs Pol2_Input\r\n\r\nSeed for pseudo-random number generator. This is necessary for simulated background option (specified below).\r\nSimulation_seed 1234567\r\n\r\nQ-value threshold applied on the final set of peaks.\r\nmax_Qvalue 0.05\r\n\r\nThere are currently two models for simulating the background for threshold selection\r\nSimulated background is the simulation based method that is explained in the PeakSeq paper.\r\nPoisson background uses a simple Poisson background with mean estimated from the read statistics. This option is still experimental but it is much faster than the simulated background option.\r\nBackground_model Poisson\r\nBackground_model Simulated\r\n\r\n\r\nconfig.dat is passed to PeakSeq as a parameter with -peak_select option\r\nPeakSeq -peak_select config.dat.\r\n\r\nPeakSeq will complain if it cannot find a mandatory entry in the configuration file.\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n=======\r\nPeakSeq dumps a narrowPeak file (httpencodewiki.ucsc.eduEncodeDCCindex.phpFile_Formats#narrowPeak_Narrow_.28or_Point-Source.29_Peaks_Format) and a txt file with peaks. The peak region, p-value, q-value, and enrichment statistics are reported in the output file.\r\n\r\nFeedbackCommentsQuestions\r\n============================\r\nAre always welcome.
